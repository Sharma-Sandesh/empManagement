A simple employee management system in C, with error logging (can be read over a TCP network) : localhost:8080

(Could still have some bugs. I haven't worked on it since my first build)

gcc -o empManagement linkedList_v2.c -lws2_32 

No -lws2_32 flag needed on Linux Enviroment.

On Linux
./executable_name empInfo.bin

On windows

executable_name -> empManagement if compiled with above instructions.
Can be changed to your desire.

empInfo.bin contains employee details.
